    The **Adopt** ring represents blips that we think you should seriously consider using.
    We don't say that you should use these for every project; any tool should only be used in an appropriate context.
    However we do think that a blip in the Adopt ring represents something where there's no doubt that it's proven and mature for use.

    The **Trial** ring is for blips that we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven 
    as those in the Adopt ring. So for most projects we think you should use these on a trial basis,
    to decide whether they should be part of your toolkit.

    The **Assess** ring are things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet - unless you think they
     would be a particularly good fit for you.
     Typically, blips in the Assess ring are things that we think are interesting and worth keeping an eye on.

    The **Hold** ring is for things that, even though they are accepted in the industry, 
    we haven't had a good experience with.
    Therefore we are calling them out to warn you that you may run into trouble with them as well.
    Sometimes this is because we don't think they're mature enough yet;
    sometimes it means we think they're irredeemably flawed; or just being misused.
    We do place things in the Hold ring that we wish the projects wouldn't use.
