  <p>.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.</p>

<p>With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.</p>

<h3 id="adopt-may-2021">ADOPT: May 2021</h3>

<p>We previously had .NET Core in Adopt, indicating that it had become our default for .NET projects. But we felt it’s worth again calling attention to .NET Core. With the release of .NET Core 3.x last year, the bulk of the features from .NET Framework have now been ported into .NET Core. With the announcement that .NET Framework is on its last release, Microsoft have reinforced the view that .NET Core is the future of .NET. Microsoft has done a lot of work to make .NET Core container friendly. Most of our .NET Core–based projects target Linux and are often deployed as containers. The upcoming .NET 5 release looks promising, and we’re looking forward to it.</p>

<h3 id="adopt-may-2018">ADOPT: May 2018</h3>

<p>Our teams have confirmed that .NET Core has reached a level of maturity that makes it the default for .NET server applications. The open source .NET Core framework enables the development and deployment of .NET applications on Windows, macOS and Linux with first-class cross-platform tooling. Microsoft provides blessed Docker images which make it easy to deploy .NET Core applications in a containerized environment. Positive directions in the community and feedback from our projects indicate that .NET Core is the future for .NET development.</p>

<h3 id="trial-nov-2017">TRIAL: Nov 2017</h3>

<p>We’re seeing increased adoption of .NET Core, the open source cross-platform software framework. .NET Core enables the development and deployment of .NET applications on Windows, macOS and Linux. With the release of .NET Standard 2.0 increasing the number of standard APIs across .NET platforms, the migration path to .NET Core has become clearer. Issues related to library support on .NET Core are becoming less problematic, and first-class cross-platform tooling is now available, allowing for productive development on non-Windows platforms. Blessed Docker images are provided to make it easy to integrate .NET Core services into a containerized environment. Positive directions in the community and feedback from our projects indicate that .NET Core is ready for widespread use.</p>
