    <h2>What is the Tech Radar?</h2>
    <p>
      A Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called ring assignment. We use four
      rings and four quadrants with the following semantics:

  <h2>What is the purpose?</h2>
  <p>
    The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support developers to pick the best technologies for new
    projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology
    decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape.
    Based on the pioneering work of <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">ThoughtWorks</a> and
    the open source project of <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/">Zalando</a>, our Tech
    Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development â€” changes that we think our
    engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
  </p>

  <h2>How do we maintain it?</h2>
  <p>
    The Tech Radar is maintained by a group of architects who faciliate and drive the technology selection
    and discussion across the company. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring
    change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for contribution for all developers
    and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to
    good practices on using the technologies.
